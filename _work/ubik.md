In 2019, after meditating regularly for a few hundred days, I experienced a strange phenomenon known as [astral projection](https://www.supermeditate.me/the-astral-express).  It was a jarring experience that left me questioning whether consciousness is truly confined to the brain, or if it can exist independently.

Most efforts looking for the origins of consciousness have looked for it within the brain, however an easier approach may exist: looking for it outside of the brain by detecting the presence of astral projectors.

This hasn't been attempted in part because "ghost detection" is not regarded as serious science, but also because it's hard to find people who can reliably astral project.  However, growing numbers of APers combined with easily-available electronics has opened up new avenues for testing.

# What is Ubik?

Ubik, named after a Philip K. Dick novel in which the dead can speak through electronics, is a device designed to act as a "surrogate brain", allowing those in the AP / OBE state to interact with it in a way that would not otherwise be possible.

Functionally, Ubik is very simple---it's an RF-shielded microvoltmeter which logs ambient voltage in a saltwater solution over time.  A typical 8-hour readout looks like this:

Ubik is designed to be low-cost and easy to assemble. Most of the parts can be ordered from Amazon and total less than $400 USD (see: parts list), making it practical for anyone around the world to build and test.


# Theory
If consciousness exists outside the brain, it must have an interface through which the two can communicate.

The most distinguishing feature of an AP is what's known as the vibrational state, which feels a lot like being electrocuted by an AC current.
