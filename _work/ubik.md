One of the most unusual side-effects of meditation is a phenomena known as astral projection, in which one's consciousness seems to separate from the body and roam around other realms in a fully-lucid state.

I was skeptical of this until I began to experience it myself, after which I became quite curious as to whether consciousness might exist independently of the brain itself.

For this to be possible, some kind of interface would have to exist between the two, allowing them to communicate---but what would such an interface look like?  A distinct phenomenon preceding astral projection may provide clues.

# The Vibrational State
In order to AP, one must first reach a state known as the "vibrational state", which can only be described as being unceremoneously plugged into a high-voltage electrical outlet.  The body, while stock-still on the outside, is gripped by an overpowering vibrational surge which immediately overwhelms the senses and triggers a fight or flight response.  Overcoming this natural fear is an essential part of learning to AP, becaue it is only during this state that one can successfully "separate" from the body.

Why would such an unusual state be a universal prerequisite to AP?  If we assume for a moment that consciousness is distinct from the brain's own electrical signals, the vibrational state could be interpreted as the interference pattern created when these two signals---normally coupled---move out of phase with each other.

# Phase Sync
Phase synchronization is a common phenomenon seen in many systems involving wave mechanics, whether physical or electrical.  It's most often illustrated by ____, and it is utilized in areas such as the electrical grid to synchronize disparate AC sources into a steady 60 Hz.

When two signals are coupled, the dominant signal tends to shift the other into phase with it in a phenomenon known as phase synchronization.  While the two signals are still separate, they appear as one unless shifted out of phase, a process which is resisted by the coupling itself.  Because of this, the brain's own electrical signals could be hiding our second hypothetical "consciousness signal", and we would be unaware of it.

That the brain produces electrical signals is not disputed, and recent research suggests that thalamo-cortical resonance may play a role in consciousness.  Thus we can imagine a scenario in which either some or all of the brain acts as an [oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_oscillator), producing a dominant signal which consciousness is coupled to.


# Phase Theory of Consciousness
Phase-coupled signals inherently share information, providing a bidirectional communication channel necessary for the kind of throughput required for a brain / consciousness interface.  In this model, all sensory input--vision, touch, taste, etc---is caused by the brain's signals pushing against consciousness, and everything that is volitional---movements, speech, actions, etc---are the result of consciousness pushing against the brain.

This theory explains, among other things, the subjective experience of willpower.  For example, let's say you want to stop yourself from expressing a habit, such as eating a cookie.  To do this, your consciousness must be strong enough to overcome your force of habit, otherwise you "give in" and eat the cookie.  In this model, your desire to eat the cookie is a function of your brain's electrical system, and your willpower must exert an electrical force strong enough to inhibit (presumably through voltage-gated ion channels) the firing of those neurons.

Phase Theory also explains other peculiarities of consciousness such as why we can be "knocked out" by a punch---the force simply must be sufficient enough to disrupt the brain's signal, which knocks the two tmeporarily out of phase and eliminates consciousness until sync is regained.

# Meditation & Amplitude

It's always been an enigma why meditation---the simple act of sitting still and focusing---would cause the variety of unusual effects that it does, however in this model it is clear:  Regular, prolonged focus serves to strengthen the "consciousness signal" much like a muscle, ultimately allowing it to become dominant and break out of phase with the brain.

Given that, it's no surprise that astral projection only occurs under conditions where the brain is relatively inactive, such as sleep or deep meditation.  As the weaker signal, consciousness can only compete with the brain once the latter is sufficiently calm, at which point it can shift out of phase.  This naturally creates wave interference between the brain and consciousness, which we experience subjectively as the vibrational state.


# Extraordinary Claims
It's a fine theory, but nothing matters if we can't test it, so how do we do that?

There are only two ways that we know of to reliably influence the firing of neurons: chemical (via neurotransmitters) and electrical (via voltage-gated ion channels).  Chemical synthesis is too slow to keep pace with the refresh rate of consciousness, therefore the interface is most likely to be electrical.

If consciousness both exerts a weak electrical influence and can exist separately from the brain, it should be possible to observe it by creating a "surrogate brain" and interacting with it while in a state of astral projection.

The key here---and the reason this has never before been tested---is that you need someone who can reliably astral project, otherwise no results would be expected.  While bound to the brain, consciousness cannot affect anything but the brain's own signal, thus a qualified astral projector must first separate out and only then attempt to interface with the device.

# Ubik

Named after a Philip K. Dick novel in which the dead can speak through electronics, Ubik is a sensor designed to act as a "surrogate brain", allowing those in the AP / OBE state to interact with it in a way that would not otherwise be possible.

Functionally, Ubik is very simple---it's an RF-shielded microvoltmeter which logs ambient voltage in a saltwater solution over time.  A typical 8-hour readout looks like this:

Ubik is designed to be low-cost and easy to assemble. Most of the parts can be ordered from Amazon and total less than $400 USD (see: parts list), making it practical for anyone around the world to build and test.


# Theory
If consciousness exists outside the brain, it must have an interface through which the two can communicate.
