I am a [maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture), [meditator](https://www.supermeditate.me/meditations-missing-manual), and engineer based in the SF Bay Area.  My main interest is applying the scientific method to phenomena traditionally thought of as "spiritual". I'm currently producing a documentary film entitled [Super Meditate Me](http://supermeditate.me).
